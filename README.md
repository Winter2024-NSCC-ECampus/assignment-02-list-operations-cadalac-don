This programs goes through various node info and tasks. I used CLion, which seemed to crash my computer a few times with Nodes. This is why you should comment certain section of code when you try to run it. It is the IDE issues and not the programmer at fault. 

I show the following capabilities of insertion: at the beginning, at the end, at the given location in the sorted list

I show the following capabilities of deletion: of first node, of last node, of given item index from sorted list

I can split a list, sort it and add it together. If original list is odd, add one additional number to the first half of the list.

I often demonstrate my code a few times and in no particular order.
