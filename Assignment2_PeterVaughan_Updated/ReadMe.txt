This programs goes through various node info and tasks. I do add some node info at the beginning portion of the code. This had no memory issues.

I show the following capabilities of insertion: at the beginning, at the end, at the given location in the sorted list

I show the following capabilities of deletion: of first node, of last node, of given item index from sorted list

I can split a list, sort it and add it together. If original list is odd, add one additional number to the first half of the list.

I often demonstrate my code a few times and in no particular order.
